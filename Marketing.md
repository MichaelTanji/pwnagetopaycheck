# Marketing

Marketing is the art and science of getting people to understand what you’re doing, why its good for them, and to get them to try (and then buy). 

## Message

What are you doing? What problem do you solve? Why you over the competition? Think about all the question you ask when you're deciding to make a major purchase; that's what everyone else is going to be asking you. You need to have answers. Compelling answers.

## Medium

Is social media going to be a part of your marketing efforts? You need to do your homework and figure out which platforms are most likely to produce a return on investment. 

## What About Conferences?

I have a contrarian view of the conference game. I’m not anti-conference, I’m anti-security conference. AT least from the perspective of the value it brings to the business. A key point of any conference is that you have a (sometwhat) captive audience. Hundreds if not thousands (or in the case of major Cons tens of thousands) of people show up every day, for multiple days.

A key problem with security cons is that in a convention center filled with hundreds of competitors, all with similar sounding names, all using the same buzzwords, how is anyone supposed to know that they should talk to you? Its become impossible to do so. The result is companies spend a lot of money on gimmicks to get you to come to talk to them. I’m not talking swag, but basically shows. My favorite example was a “booth” I saw at RSA several yers ago. It wasn’t a booth per se, but a boxing ring. Every 30 minutes a low-rent Michael Buffer would get on the mic and announce the upcoming fight between the APTs and the vendor’s product. A game show hostess clone would do the ring girl routine, and the boxers (legit featherweights) would take the ring and the announcer would talk through the bout. The APTs always started out winning a few (abbreviated) rounds, but in the end the customer (now equipped with the vendor’s product) would knock out the APTs.

To this day I have no idea what the name of the company was, or what their product did. Go ahead, put a gun to my head, I couldn’t do it. What was the point? Tens of thousands of dollars spent “entertaining” people and for what? No name retention.

My take is that if you’re going to go to cons, go to cons where potential customers are. If you’ve segmented the market such that a key industry for you is trucking, then find out when and where the trucking industry conference is (particularly their con that is heavy on trucking/logistics technology) and get a booth there. Why? For one, you’re probably going to be the only security company there. You’re almost certainly going to be the only security company doing what you’re doing. You’re not talking to jaded industry veterans scarred by the previous shenanigans of other vendors, you’re talking to people who have a problem that you solve. You’re talking to them in their environment, which is far less intimidating than taking a mid-sized trucking company CIO to RSA and dropping in the middle of the vendor floor (head explosion).
