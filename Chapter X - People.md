# People

## Choose wisely

This is arguably the most difficult part of what you are about to undertake. You might rock hardware or software, but things get really ugly when ‘wetware’ is added to the mix.

## Friends and family

Friends and family are your first and natural choice for finding your first partners or early hires. You know their skills and dispositions and consequently can place them in positions they are likely to succeed in. You are also prepared for the issues you know are likely to come up and can take steps to mitigate them.

The problem of course, is that when something goes sideways, you’re not having a happy conversation with your friend about how you’re going to take over the world; you’re having a very sad conversation about how they’re fired. You run the risk of losing a friend. For what? Money?

Yes, money. **Remember: you’re doing this for the Benjamins.** If that is not something you can live with, or if you think the person you’re considering is not going to be able to separate your working relationship with  your personal one, don’t hire that friend.

## Beyond friends and family

## Get it in writing

You might recruit and come to a handshake agreement about employment with your “peeps” over beers, but when it comes down to actually having someone show up for work and paying them, make sure you put a signed employment agreement in place. You may never need it, but if you do, you’ll be glad you have it. You want expectations on both sides of the equation to be clear and unambiguous. 

## Problem Children

When I was in the military, my first promotion board consisted of five grizzled old veterans, three of whom had earned their rank twice (got in trouble, demoted, and worked their way back up again) and two of whom had spent time in various stockades (military jail). It was a different time to be sure, but the key factor to their ultimate success was that they were allowed to fail, allowed to address the issues that led to their failure, and given the chance to prove they had learned and grown as soldiers and men. 

Today’s military, and society in general, isn’t as forgiving as it once was. America is still clearly the land of opportunity, but in more and more environments the ability to make a mistake and recover from it is fading rapidly, if it isn’t gone forever. We’ve taken the lessons learned from “quality” management and zero-defect manufacturing processes and mutated it into a system for managing and treating people. The key problem of course is that people are not robots. 

In larger businesses there are still ways of dealing with people who are not making the grade in one way or another. You may have heard of the phrase ‘PIP” or “performance improvement plan” before. Its basically a plan developed by your boss and HR to get someone from where they are (not in a good place) to where they need to be (a good performer).

In a start-up or small business, you don’t really have the luxury of extended PIPs or long, drawn out processes for getting people back on track. If someone is not cutting it, or if they are being disruptive and impeding progress, you have to cut their heads off sooner rather than later. 

Be fair. Make sure you do the up-front work necessary. Communicate what is expected. Explain roles and responsibilities and get positive response from the person to make sure they acknowledge what is required so there are no surprises. Document their performance - good and bad - on a regular basis and make corrections. You can't keep someone on board despite their issues and then fire them after "the last straw" and expect that to go smoothly. Especially if you're doing well, they're going to sue. You want to be able to go to arbitration, or court, on a rock solid foundation backed by documentation. Yes, its a pain in the ass. Yes, it seems like something you don't need in a start-up or small business. No, "thoughts and prayers" are not going to save you.

This is a particularly difficult thing to do in the early days, when you’re more apt to hire friends and family. Everyone wants to give friends and family a break. To give them more leeway than they would strangers. Its OK, its natural, but you can’t do it if you hope to succeed.
