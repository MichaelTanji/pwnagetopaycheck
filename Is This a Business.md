# Is this a Business? 

As stated earlier, a business exists to make a profit. There are myriad ways you can do that, but ideally you’ve come up with an idea that fills a pressing need. The wider this need is spread across markets or industries, the better.  

## Filling a need

Let me be clear about what "filling a need" means. There are two major components to filling a need. The first is that the 'need' has to address a real problem. It is not enough that your idea reduces inconvenience, unless that inconvenience costs people money. That seems like a fine line so let me give you an example: Imagine you are a sys admin and you are reguarly asked to create/delete accounts for new hires/people who leave the firm. The process involves the movement of paper - if you're lucky email - and you doing a lot of cut-and-paste from the input HR gives you into all the mechanisms required to create/delete an account. You could create a script that automates a lot of that manual work, which would save time and money. Because you use the most popular HR software in the world and the most popular operating system in the world, this is something that with a little massaging could be used by millions around the world.

Except that it wont. Why? Because its not that big of a problem, merely an inconvenience. A program that automated all HR, physical, technical, security, financial, and social (that 'unboxing experience' of new company-issued gear people get to have when they join companies that care about that sort of thing) tasks once a hiring manager pushed "hire" in a system would be solving a problem. That's not minutes of time and a few dollars saved every day; that's hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars saved every day.

The other component to filling a need is that it has to be, more or less, a global need. That you and four of your buddies think its a great idea isn't adequate. That everyone in the X industry, all 10,000 of them, isn't adequate. You laugh at that guy who does the foam pillow infomercials but you know what pretty much everyone in the developed - and a fair amount of the under-developed - world uses? A pillow. That guy is selling pillows all day long and making a metric a**-ton of money doing it. 

## Can YOU Do It?

If you’re confident in your approach to solving the problem, the outstanding question remains whether or not you’re the one to make it all happen. This is not casting an aspersion on your abilities as an individual, but a recognition that some problems are so big and complex that a start-up is an ulikely source of victory. Remember what I said earlier about how some problems require a big company to solve? All big companies were small at one point, but especially when it comes to technology, size has advantages. 

Example? Encrypted email. A powerful way to protect privacy. Yet unless you use a service like Proton Mail, encrypting emails is a pretty big pain the ass for the ordinary person. Pick a grandparent, or anyone younger whose only ever been a *user* of technology. Now think about the process for installing an email client and gpg and how well that would work with that individual. 

Exactly. 

Most people in the world access email via a browser, and if we assume – safely so- that Gmail is the most popular webmail service in the world, the biggest impact on email content security/privacy would be gmail implementing encryption between senders. Of course Google isn’t an email company, its an advertising company, so that’s never going to happen. But you get my point: your idea for encrypting email via a browser is never going to work for a critical mass of people without the help of Google, so your ability to make a dent in the email privacy problem is effectively zero.

Everyone was small at some point, but the small companies that grew big did so because they didn't depend on the big ones cutting them a break.

## Competition

Whether you seek investment or are just socializing your idea to potential partners or customers, the question is going to come up: who is your competition.

Fools! Your idea is soooo genius that you can’t believe no one has thought of this before. You’ve worked the googles and see no one else is doing what you’re proposing to do. You literally have no competition.

Wrong answer.

You’re looking at hte problem from a hacker's perspective and not a businessperson’s perspective. From a business perspective the prospect of no competition is not merely scary, its stupid. There is, to coin a phrase, nothing new under the sun. **The odds that you’ve come up with something truly novel is very close to zero.** Its not impossible, but unlikely. On the off chance that you have come up with something novel, you have to ask yourself a couple of important questions:

* Is this sufficiently weird? Your customers have budgets. They spend those budgets in accordance with certain pre-defined needs, like end-point protection or network monitoring. If your solution doesn’t fit neatly into those budget categories, no one is spending money on you.
* Is this a group effort? In most organizations of any size, security has actually very little control over the underlying technology used by the company. If you need to access a span port to make your solution work, you need to have at least two conversations: one with the security nerds, and one with the IT people (the latter might not really like or want to help the former).
* Is there no competition becuase you're a genius who can see into the future, or because there are other factors that preclude this approach being viable? For example: is your approach to addressing a security problem require fiddling with the kernel? And does that fiddling sometimes blue screen an endpoint? Yeah, no one else is selling that because no one is buying that.

A lack of competition isn’t a reflection of your ingenuity, it’s a recognition that you’re facing an uphill battle of epic proportions that is almost certainly doomed to failure.
