## Establish Independence

The person who handles your financial issues needs to have some level of independence from you, the founder(s). If its just you then this is not that big a deal, but even so, it helps to put yourself into a particular mindset when you're doing the books (you're playing the role of accountant/CPA/CFO, not founder/CEO). As soon as things get big enough or complicated enough you need to outsource this job to a professional. That processional will have an agreement that establishes roles and responsibilities and sets expectations. Read it. Ask questions if you don't understand something. Act like this person is handling your money, because they are.

## Aim for Transparency

Establish a policy now about what financial information you will share with other members of the company. Co-founders deserve to know the state of things on a regular basis because, like you, they've taken on a lot of risk and they deserve to know the complete and unvarnished truth. As time passes and your team grows, what you share with whom is going to change. Strategic hires for C-level positions and board members naturally know more than lower levels of technical staff. In some companies line employees know next to nothing about a firm's financial situation; in others the amount of data shared is highly irregular. You don't have to reveal everything, but even addressing things at a relatively meta level is a great way to build confidence and reduce ambiguity.

## Rigor

Keep records. File (and pay) taxes. Follow the rules of accounting that apply to your line of business. Don't fudge your expense reports. Your accountant and/or other financial professionals will go over all this, but the bottom line is that you're not smarter than the IRS. Lots of people thought they were; you can look them up in the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Your little start-up might not hit the IRS radar for years, but at some point someone is going to want to look at your books and the less shenanigans in them the better. Establish strong policies and adhere to them like your firm's livelihood dependend on it, because it might. Make compliance and honestly a part of your culture up front and you won't have to worry about it coming back to bite you in the ***.
