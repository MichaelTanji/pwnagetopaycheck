# Do You Even Business, Bro?

Before you strike out on your own, you need to have a frank and honest conversation with yourself and several trusted friends and advisers. The subject of this conversation is **whether or not you are cut out to start and run a business.** This seems like an obvious thing, but you would be surprised how many people don’t take this step. Everyone reads the entrepreneur porn and thinks that brains or gonads will be enough. I mean, if <insert name of person who started a company who you hate here> can do it so can you, right?

Understand that when you strip away all the platitudes, a business exists to make money. More precisely: **the goal of every business is to make a profit.** Don't confuse this core fact with all the rest of the rigmarole associated with starting a company. You want to do good, yes. You have the best solution, sure. Something something the proletariat, we get it. All of that is fine and dandy, but the bottom line (no pun intended) is that you can't do any of that if you're not making money.

There are a number of reasons why businesses falter or fail, but if I had to point to some common denominators for those cases I'm familiar with, it would boil down to:

* It wasn’t a good business idea.
* An unwillingness to do what was necessary.

## It Wasn’t a Good Business Idea

In the wake of the revelations of what the National Security Agency was doing with metadata, a wave of concern about privacy and security online swept the planet.

For about two minutes.

If you’ve been in this industry for more than a day you know that the ordinary person doesn’t really understand what it takes to have a strong security posture and maintain a level of privacy online. Most people will gladly give up their personal information to the grocery store (and the store’s deal with a data broker) for $.50 off of albacore tuna. Developing a very powerful and strong Internet privacy solution in the wake of the aforementioned revelations would seem like a sure thing, right?

Not so much.

The problem with building a high-end privacy solution is that it takes extra time and effort to implement. Even when you try to simplify things for non-experts, the amount of friction associated with protecting yourself online is never zero, which means everyone who is used to swiping or clicking to install apps or get things done online is going to find it too time consuming and tedious to implement. If you’re a security nerd you know that if a security mechanism goes wrong its often not the technology or the underlying math, but the implementation that gets you. 

History is filled with examples of the market going in one direction despite the fact that a superior solution lay in the opposite direction. Business success depends on you understanding the market you’re trying to succeed in and building a solution that is likely to be accepted, not swim upstream.

## An Unwillingness to do What Was Necessary

If you're a team of 2 or 3, you do not have the luxury of _just_ coding (especially true if you're trying to do this solo). Elegant code has never sold itself. If there are 100 things that have to get done every day to launch and operate a going concern, 98 of them have nothing to do with you being on keyboard. **If you are not prepared to do things you don't like, or bring on a partner to deal with those things, find a way to make peace with a life as someone's employee.** 

To be clear: *There is nothing wrong with working for other people.* I have been someone's employee a lot longer than I have worked for myself. More people in the world work for other people than work for themselves. If you're doing something you like to do and are good at it, and wonder if all the hype about being an "entrepreneur" is all its cracked up to be, don't feel like you have to rush headlong into something because you're going to miss out. There is plenty of work to do, and in some cases the only way it gets done is via the power and resources of a huge company.

Who should you talk to as you try to assess your likely success? Aim for not only diversity, but intimacy. That is to say people in a wide range of businesses and business roles, and people who know you well. Ideally these are all the same people, but if that’s not possible err towards the diversity because if you’re being honest with yourself, you’ll know after talking to the various business practitioners if this is the right path for you. 

If you know someone who has started another security company they should obviously be on the top of your list, but also make sure you include people in different lines of business. Why? You’re not going to be selling your product or service to other security companies, you’re going to be selling to people in other fields. Having some idea of how other firms operate, and what people in those firms care about, will be invaluable as you start to develop your arguments for ‘why you’ and give you an understanding of the issues and time-frames you’re going to face when it comes time to start knocking on doors and shaking hands (more on this when we talk about marketing and sales).
