# Sales

Hackers hate sales. 

I said it. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to admit it. There it is.

The problem of course is that there is no business without sales. Going back to chapter one, remember the whole point of a business is to make money. No solution ever sold itself. I don’t care how elegant your code is, throwing up a Shopify site and calling it a day is not going lead to achieving “unicorn” status (or even paying the rent). If you're going to succeed, you’re going to have to sell.

*This does not mean you have to become a “salesperson.”*

You know what I mean. You know *who* I mean. There is a difference between communicating a value proposition and working a process, and all the things you associate – and dispise – about sales.

Having said that, there are a few things you need to learn from salespeople that will help you achieve your goals.

## Understand Who Makes Decisions

You've built something cool. You've told all your friends in 20 different companies all about it. They all love it. That's 20 customers on launch day, right?

Wrong.

Your elegent solution might impress your fellow nerds, but do you know what nerds don't do? Nerds don't write checks. Executives write checks. Maybe managers write (small) checks. The people who love your product and the people who will pay for your product are almost always two different people.

It gets worse.

The decision to buy your solution might not rest in the hands of one person. Does your solution need some kind of access to network resources? Well that means IT has to be involved (pro tip: in a lot of companies Security is under IT, or separate from IT, or some other configuration). Now we're up to two people who may be involved in writing that check. Is there some regulatory issue your solution addresses? Well that's at least one (compliance dude) and probably two (legal) that will be involved. 

## Understand How Decisions Are Made

All the aforementioned people that might be involved in deciding to buy your solution don't all figure that out over beers at Frank's house. The name of the internal group varies from organization to organization, but at some point in time, usually on a regular basis, all the right people all get into a room and figure out what to spend money on. How do you get on the next meeting's agenda? Is it even possible to do so in a meaningful time-frame? What sort of briefings and/or politicking do you need to do before hand? Do you get to be there when they discuss things or do you have to submit a packet for them to review? 

## Understand When Decisions Are Made

Thinking of selling to government organizations? Count on at least a year-long sales cycle. Federal government? Probably longer. Unless your solution addresses an issue of critical importance (e.g. counter-DDOS solution in the midst of a gov't system getting DDOSed), nothing is going to happen out of cycle. A lot of large commercial firms follow a federal-type model in that purchasing decisions are made over an extended period of time, and the money let loose only once a year. 

## Develop a Process

Understanding that every potential customer has their own way of doing things, and that a sale is not simply a function of showing up and dazzling people with a demo, you need to develop a process (or processes) to follow. You need to follow it. Religiously. Do not allow a potential deal to advance in your mind (or heart) without a positive and definitive 'check mark' that every step in the process has been checked off. Of course everyone says thing are going well and that the deal is on track, but that's just talk. NDA not in place? No deal. Contract not approved by legal? No deal. All the key players haven't been briefed/demo'd? No deal.
