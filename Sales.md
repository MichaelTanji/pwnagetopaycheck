# Sales

Hackers hate sales. 

I said it. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to admit it. There it is.

The problem of course is that there is no business without sales. Going back to chapter one, remember the whole point of a business is to make money. No solution ever sold itself. I don’t care how elegant your code is, throwing up a Shopify site and calling it a day is not going lead to achieving “unicorn” status (or even paying the rent). If youre going to succeed, you’re going to have to sell.
This does not mean you have to become a “salesperson.”

You know what I mean. You know who I mean. There is a difference between communinating a value proposition and working a process, and all the things you associate – and dispise – about sales.
