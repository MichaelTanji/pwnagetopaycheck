## You Need a Lawyer

Do not think that you can get away with launching without having someone on board to give you legal advice. A good business (you might hear the phrase 'transactional') lawyer is worth their weight in platinum. You might not have to worry about jail in your line of business, but you almost certainly will worry about bankruptcy brought on by you having to pay someone all your money because you didn't adhere to some term in some sub-paragraph of an agreement you entered into. The people you are doing business with will almost certainly have lawyers both on staff and on retainer and they are not going to let your mistakes slide if the advantage to them is big enough.

I say "on board" but that doesn't mean "employee". You're going to outsource this job like everything else you're not good at and is not a part of your core business. 

Where do you find an attorney? Like so many things we've talked about so far, start with friends and family. Friends and family who run their own business. Aunt Alice whose neighbor litigates for the government isn't going to be a big help, but he might know a guy who knows a guy. Really though, anyone you know who is in business for themselves has their own lawyer and should be happy to make introductions. If they are not, that's probably not a guy you want to talk to anyway.

How do you know who to hire? A rule of thumb is to find someone who knows how to get to 'yes.' Lawyers love to say 'no.' Its safer to say 'no.' You really can't get in much trouble if your default answer to any question is 'no.' The problem is that you're bringing these ideas to your lawyer because you think they'll be good for business. Are all of these ideas risk-free? No, of course not, but the goal is not to avoid risk, but to mitigate or manage it. A good attorney is going to listen to your idea, and then ask questions like, "what is it you're really trying to accomplish?" Because let's face it: you're probably talk to her five minutes after reading some story in a magazine or blog post about how so-and-so did X and it totally revolutionized their business. You gotta get you some o' that, right?

Maybe.

Once the two of you have had your come-to-Jesus about what it is you're trying to accomplish, a good lawyer will figure out if the approach you brought them is actually something that will work for you. Maybe it is, but there might be another way. A better way. A way that allows them to leverage their knowledge and experience and connections to get you where you want to be, vice that hot mess you brought to the table.

## Don't Play Fast and Loose

You're smart. You can read. Why do you need to have your lawyer review every contract or agreement? 

Well, for one thing it'll help keep you in business. For another it'll help reduce the chance that you'll have to do something you don't want to do, or simply can't do, but are on the hook for anyway.

Let your lawyer do her job. She knows things you don't. She understands why contracts or other agreements are written the way they are, in the language they are, and what it all really means (should things go to court), and you don't. 

## Don't be Afraid of Delays

Lawyers are busy. You are not their only client. You are not their biggest client. Not that that necessarily matters when it comes to their priorities, but a lawyer's day is full and if you're not in the queue for that day, you're going to have to wait (they need to sleep too). There is almost no situation that needs a lawyers attention right now or it all goes to s***. If you believe that is the case then by all means pick up the phone and don't take 'no' for an answer. But understand that any discussion you have with a client or partner that involves "legal" is one that everyone knows will take time. No one expects you to have a response back to them in minutes or hours. Do not promise the other side that 'it'll get taken care of by COB' if you don't know that your lawyer is literally sitting around waiting for you to call. Don't write a check your lawyer has to cash.


## Don't Take it Personally
